Run
---

You will need to run two servers. One is Ruby on Rails based app and the other is WebSocket Server.

To run the WebSocket server:

    $ lib/echo.rb --cache

If you don't want to cache the previous Sortable result, remove the "--cache" option.

Notice
------

This is only an experimental purpose application to run in your local machine.
